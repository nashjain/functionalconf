                  <p>In 2018, we plan to structure the conference as follows:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li><b>Pre-Conference Paid Workshops</b> - Full Day hands-on workshops by our international speakers to allow you to go deep into a specific topic. Each workshop is capped at around 20 participants.</li>
                      <li>
                          <b>FP Bootcamp</b>: A full day program for Developers, who want to kick start their FP journey. Participants would be able to pick any one from the following tracks and stick to it for the full day.
                          <ul>
                              <li>Haskell Ecosystem</li>

                          </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <b>Apply FP</b>: A full day program, with 3 parallel tracks for Developers, who understand the basics of FP, maybe even practice some FP at work. Helping them understand how they can apply even more FP concepts more at work.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          <b>Mastering FP</b>: A full day program, with 3 parallel tracks for Developers, who already apply decent amount of FP concepts at work. Developers, who want to go deeper and maybe even become a contributor to a FP language or library.
                      </li>
                      <li><b>Post-Conference Paid Workshops</b> - Full Day hands-on workshops by our international speakers to allow you to go deep into a specific topic. Each workshop is capped at around 20 participants.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>To present at Functional Conf 2018, please submit your proposal before June 30th 2018 via our <a href="https://confengine.com/functional-conf-2018/proposals" target="_blank">Public Proposal Submission System</a>.</p>
              </div>

              <div>
                  <h3>Review Process</h3>
                  <p>We are looking for deep technical topics related to Functional Programming. We are committed to diversity and believe in transparency. Hence, all proposals will be public.Â </p>
                  <p>Registered users of the Submission System can view and comment on your proposal. Please reply to the comments to provide clarifications, explain revisions and respond to questions. The Program team will assess how well you respond to comments and update your proposal to incorporate public suggestions. The ultimate decision to accept a session resides with the Program team.</p>
                  <p>Your proposal stands the best chance for selection if it is unique, fully flushed, and ready-to-go. Please ensure you have read:</p>
                  <ol class="list">
                      <li><a href="#selection-criteria">Selection Criteria</a> </li>
                      <li><a href="https://confengine.com/review-process#good-proposal-attributes" target="_blank">Good Proposal Attributes</a> </li>
                      <li><a href="https://confengine.com/review-process#best-chance" target="_blank">Best Selection Chance</a> </li>
                      <li><a href="https://confengine.com/review-process#tips-for-proposal" target="_blank">Tips for Proposals</a> </li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>To encourage early submissions and iterative improvement of proposals, we start accepting proposals as soon as we find them a good fit. Since competition gets tougher with progressing time, it is advisable to avoid waiting till the last minute for proposal submission.</p>

                  <a name="selection-criteria"></a>
                  <h3>We Value</h3>
                  <p>In terms of the <strong><em>overarching themes or values</em></strong> in proposals, we look at the following criteria during selection:</p>

                  <ul>
                      <li><strong>Diversity -</strong> As a conference, we wish to be more <strong>inclusive </strong>(Different approaches, frameworks, gender, countries, background etc.).</li>
                      <li><strong>Balance -</strong> We strive to <strong>strike </strong>a great <strong>balance between different types of presentations</strong> (Expert talks, experience reports, tutorials, workshops, etc.) <strong>and experiences </strong>that speakers bring to the conference.</li>
                      <li><strong>Equality -</strong> We truly encourage <strong>students and women speakers.</strong> However, this does not mean that we are biased and we select just about any proposal based only on the fact that it came from a student or female speaker. Nevertheless, if we have to make a choice between one out of two <strong>equal</strong> proposals, we will pick the one proposed by a student or female speaker.</li>
                      <li><strong>Practicality -</strong> People come to a conference to <strong>learn, network, </strong>have an<strong> experience </strong>and leave the conference <strong>feeling motivated</strong>. Proposals that facilitate this are therefore always preferred. Though some theory is good, if the proposal lacks practical application, it does not really help participants. </li>
                      <li><strong>Learning -</strong> People learn more by doing rather than listening. Therefore, the winning proposals are those that take people on a learning journey and incorporate an <strong>element of "learning by doing".</strong></li>
                      <li><strong>Opportunity -</strong> We strive to ensure that the conference has a minimum of 70% rock solid speakers. Nonetheless, we <strong>give equal opportunities to new and promising speakers having real potential.</strong></li>
                      <li><strong>Originality -</strong> It is true that people usually prefer hearing about an<strong> idea from its original creator</strong> rather than someone else. However, you may take an idea, tweak it in your context, and gain some insight(s) while doing so - People also <strong>like to hear first-hand experiences</strong> from those who are not creators of the original idea. Ultimately, we are looking for <strong>thought leadership.</strong></li>
                      <li><strong>Radical ideas -</strong> We have great respect for people who want to <strong>push boundaries</strong> <strong>and challenge the status quo. </strong>Given that we lean towards <strong>unconventional ideas, </strong>we try our best to support such people and bring greater awareness to their work.</li>
                      <li><strong>Demand - Votes </strong>on a proposal and the <strong>buzz on social media </strong>give us an idea about how many people are really interested in a certain topic. Understanding that votes can be gamed, we have a system in place that can eliminate some bogus votes and use different types of patterns to give us a decent sense of the real demand.</li>
                  </ul>
