    <p><strong>What got you into Functional Programming (FP)?</strong><br>
        I got into FP largely by accident. I was working on a game in Second Life, needed some NLP, and thought I might find somebody who wanted to hack a bit on an NLP thing at a lisp meetup. The “Lisp meetup” turned out to be a very early Clojure meetup. Loved Clojure, then later moved to Prolog
        when I ran into a Prolog programmer.</p>
    <p><strong>What has been your best moment or highlight working with FP?</strong><br>
        Working on a language is awesome! If you want to have lots of fun and learn a ton, contribute to a language.</p>
    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object oriented programmers?</strong><br>
        I don't think it's restricted to OO programmers, but - keep learning - keep learning fundamentals. You aren't a Python programmer, you're a programmer.</p>

    <p><strong>What got you into Functional Programming (FP)?</strong><br>
        I'd been programming Java and other languages for years, and as time went on I realized my productivity was holding me back. I worked with more lightweight tools, but never felt comfortable shipping to customers, knowing that I couldn't be confident in code quality. FP for me is the best of
        both worlds: a highly productive set of practices that ensure a higher quality bar. And great performance is a wonderful perk!</p>
    <p><strong>What has been your best moment or highlight working with FP?</strong><br>
        This may sound surprising, but it's probably refactoring. I strongly believe that we overoptimize for first implementation of code, and forget that we spend most of our time maintaining existing code. Requirements change, and old architecture decisions no longer make sense. Strongly typed
        functional programming allows a level of refactoring, rearchitecting, and rewriting that I would never achieve in less strongly typed solutions. The compiler is my ally.</p>
    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object oriented programmers?</strong><br>
        Learn Haskell, even if you aren't planning on using it. You <em>can</em> learn FP principles in Javascript or other hybrid languages. But being forced to do things in a purely FP language will up your skills in a way that hybrid languages rarely grant.</p>

    <p><strong>What got you into Functional Programming (FP)?</strong><br>
        At my first software engineering job (with <a href="https://www.helpshift.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helpshift.com</a>), I discovered that some problem domains are object hierarchies, some are pipelines, some are procedural, and in every case the State is the Frenemy. So, to the
        extent that I try to reduce statefulness of my code (i.e. stave off insanity and remain functional), I might agree to be labeled a “Functional” programmer.</p>
    <p><strong>What has been your best moment or highlight working with FP?</strong><br>
        In the foggy mists of time, 70-odd pages into solving SICP, I realized I'd already implemented a whole lot of logic without once setting a variable. Then it took me a few years to actually understand the implications of that. And years more to develop some intuition for when to keep The
        State at bay, and when to gingerly embrace it.<br>
        While at it, I discovered “FP” things in “OO” lands, and “OO” things in “FP” lands. Apparently one can do excellent “object oriented” programming using Clojure without knowing a single classical OO design pattern, process hundreds of GBs of logs with purely functional bash pipelines, learn
        to safely orchestrate complex infrastructure with Ansible (procedural, but idempotent), and discover new and clever ways to shoot oneself in the foot with all of these (after the foot is shot, of course).<br>
        <em>Well, well, well</em> I suppose if I zoom out enough, the whole thing will start looking like a best moment?</p>
    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object orientated programmers?</strong><br>
        All of the following, IMHO, and YMMV:<br>
        Whatever one's persuasion re: language, State is the Frenemy. The core challenge of all programming is how to cause <em>only</em> the intended effects, <em>only</em> in predictable ways. And here's the kicker… If one really stares it in the face, <em>all</em> code is inherently stateful,
        because of the many unwritten intentions and unsaid assumptions that <em>don't</em> go with it (but which are so essential to its correct working today, and to its correct transmutation over time). I.e. we're already attempting the impossible.<br>
        So, I don't think there's any one absolute reality called “object oriented” programming; nor one called “functional” programming.<br>
        I do think, however, that there's purpose-appropriate problem-solving. And that the trickiest problems that manifest in our code do not fundamentally originate in language capability, but through misunderstanding the actual problem at hand and/or our inability to solve it correctly (under
        natural constraints of money, mindspace, and markets). Also, I believe, these problems are due to our recently-acquired penchant for seeking technological solutions to <em>whatever</em> may be the problem (real or imagined). Said more tongue-in-cheek; whether mainstream or niche, <strong>object
            oriented</strong> or <strong>functional</strong>; if deleted code is good code, then <em>averted</em> code is great code.<br>
        Concurrent to these comments; one can't beat the laws of Physics. Entropy will always surprise us in ways we cannot imagine or plan for. I feel that the humility and watchfulness that come through acquiring this perspective are far better bedfellows than the paradigms and preconceptions that
        come bundled with Language Oriented Problem Solving (or LOPSided programming).</p>

        some of the key takeaways from your session?</strong><br>
        Steal good ideas from wherever you find them (legally, of course), and figure out how to apply them appropriately in your context. I'd declare my session a success if it gets people to seriously wonder:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Could there be value to modeling domain entities as immutable data structures?</li>
        <li>Of transforming and manipulating said entities with “pure” functions?, and</li>
        <li>What kind of leverage can one derive from a “Live”/Interactive programming workflow?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>What got you into Functional Programming (FP)?</strong><br>
        My first job had me writing ETL jobs on Apache Spark, and my company encouraged me to learn Scala to better deal with its DSL. Over the years, I got into the deeper concepts of FP to better understand the math and design patterns behind it, and here I am, 4 years later, still feeling that
        there is a world of concepts yet to be uncovered.</p>
    <p><strong>What has been your best moment or highlight working with FP?</strong><br>
        FP has not been the easiest to grasp so whenever I cross the ‘Great Filter' when it comes to a new concept is always a significant day for me. Code just starts looking different each time you truly grasp the idea behind it. Over the years, I've seen so many problems in software design and
        programming that have been solved so elegantly by FP which only vindicates my blind trust in spending years poring through books and literature. My best moment would probably be if I can encourage at least one person to go back after my talk and dedicate themselves to learning FP, because FP
        is the past, present and future of programming.</p>
    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object oriented programmers?</strong><br>
        My very first memory of starting to work in FP was how much I had to unlearn the OOP background I had from college. As with anything in life, approach FP with the eagerness of a student who knows nothing, free of biases and you'll come out gaining a lot more than you expected. It is very
        common to see programmers writing in FP languages in a very non-FP paradigm. A little effort in understanding the nuances and what additional capabilities a language offers goes a long way in improving productivity. I don't like to get into a debate on which language is better. The more
        languages you come across, the more you understand the strengths of each and the wisdom to know when to use them.</p>
    <p><strong>You are presenting - <a href="https://confengine.com/functional-conf-2018/proposal/6548/algebraic-data-types-just-my-kinda-type" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Algebraic Data Types: Just my kinda Type</a> - at the conference. What are some of the key takeaways from your
        session?</strong><br>
        My talk is about a very fundamental idea in designing data structures which is almost ingrained in us over years of working, to the point that it is almost a subconscious factor while coding. My aim is to highlight the nuances and to appreciate the mathematical rigour behind it so that it
        becomes a more conscious choice the next time you think about designing domain classes or a library. A proper foundation goes a long way into the lifecycle of software development, and I hope people can take away some useful ideas.</p>

    Functional Programmer @ Atlassian</a></h4>
    <p><strong>What got you into Functional Programming (FP)?</strong><br>
        I learned Python, Pascal, Delphi and PHP during classes in high school. My university went on to teach more Python, then Java, C#, C++ and a few other languages. I thought all of these were fairly similar so I wanted to learn something different. I heard somewhere that Haskell was completely
        different. I started to look into it and realised it's exactly how I wanted to write software.</p>
    <p><strong>What has been your best moment or highlight working with FP?</strong><br>
        Watching team members learn functional programming while solving problems, then becoming very skilled at it. I have worked with team members who have been introduced to functional programming, then a year later have talked about category theory concepts that I have no idea about.</p>
    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object oriented programmers?</strong><br>
        There is no inherent downside to functions. Trade-offs are only present in applications of functional programming. There is no reason why functions can't do what you're doing now!</p>

        sessions?</strong><br>
        The Data61 fp-course is great at teaching fundamentals of functional data structures and common operations on them. I'm hoping to get through at least Optional, List and Functor.</p>
    <p>With Eta and Nix, I will show how to deploy a JVM application using only functional programming. The application will only use functions. The infrastructure will be defined using only functions.</p>
    <p><strong>The conference has a total of 54 sessions. Which of these sessions are you excited to attend?</strong><br>
        My interests are all over the place. I am interested in <a href="https://confengine.com/functional-conf-2018/proposal/7015/purely-functional-user-interfaces-that-scale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user interfaces</a>, <a

    <p><strong>What got you into FP ?</strong><br>
        I discovered Scala way back around 2008 when Martin first introduced the language. Coming from a Java background, I was impressed with the succinctness of the language. Till then I was looking at Scala as a better Java and was learning some of the concepts of algebraic data types, pattern
        matching, traits etc. Many of the FP concepts like higher order functions were new to me and I suddenly found myself using them in some of my personal projects. And not only did the code become more concise, it was more expressive too. One of the foundational papers that I read during this
        time was Why Functional Programming Matters by <a href="https://confengine.com/user/john-hughes-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Hughes</a> that clearly demonstrated all the goodness that FP brings to your programming world. It was also around this time I discovered quite a lot of
        resources on FP and I specifically remember 1 paper by Graham Hutton on folding of data structures that had a lasting impact on me. At around the same time I came across a library in Scala named “scalaz” which was basically Haskell in Scala. I think scalaz was possibly the most dominant
        impact that inspired me to do FP in Scala. In course of time I got into Haskell, Idris etc. and now I can say that I love FP.</p>
    <p><strong>What has been your best moment or highlight working with FP ?</strong><br>
        I think when I could use the principles of FP on large projects implementing real world domain models, I felt good. In theory FP makes you write modular code that are easier to reason about than imperative code. But experiencing it in a real world project was an Aha! moment for me.</p>
    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object oriented programmers?</strong><br>
        John Carmac once mentioned on twitter that “Sometimes, the elegant implementation is just a function. Not a method. Not a class. Not a framework. Just a function.” This will be my advice as well - keep your eyes open and choose the best tool for your implementation.</p>
    <p><strong>You are presenting- <a href="https://confengine.com/functional-conf-2018/proposal/7773/power-of-functions-in-a-typed-world-on-the-jvm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Power of Functions in a Typed World on the JVM</a> / <a

        sessions?</strong><br>
        The first session is a tutorial targeted mostly towards the beginners of FP. I will try to demonstrate how FP in a statically typed language makes your program more expressive, modular, testable and easier to reason about. I will show some samples of real world code that I have implemented
        using pure FP in Scala. I will start with some theory of what types are, how they form an algebra and how alignment of types leads to function composition.</p>
    <p>The second talk is a bit advanced where I will talk about how to handle effects in Scala using algebraic techniques. Side-effects are ubiquitous in a model and FP offers techniques to handle them in a pure and referentially transparent way. Of course you need to execute side-effects when you
        interact with the run time system. But till then you can program with pure values that offer composability to build larger abstractions out of smaller ones. I will discuss some patterns and techniques that are used in the wild today.</p>
    <p><strong>The conference has a total of 54 sessions. Which of these sessions are you excited to attend?</strong><br>
        <a href="https://confengine.com/functional-conf-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Functional Conf</a> is possibly the only conference in FP that offers so much variety of functional programming languages. I am looking forward to many of these especially the Haskell ones.</p>

    <p><strong>What got you into Functional Programming (FP)?</strong><br>
        Personally my drive to improve myself in order to craft better solutions, esp. in the face of multi-core machines.</p>
    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object oriented programmers?</strong><br>
        Thats correct, now mainstream languages have added FP features - its like one is travelling in Merc, other is using Jaguar and still other is using Audi, but they are still cars, they all have steering wheel, wheels, gear train etc…and only varying in degrees here and there! We are yet to
        see an aeroplane! This is a facial view. But deep down, each language have their own reasons to be the way they are.</p>
    <p>Advice to OO Programmers…I am reading this as programmers using languages like Java, C#, C++ for their day-today work! Approach Functional Programming paradigm with an open mind, imbibe how it makes us think differently when approaching similar problems in known paradigms, infer the pro and
        cons, finally apply it in your day-to-day work. I come from OO background and for me FP changed the way I looked at the code and design. I'm able to appreciate the underlying values of FP. As I explore further into array-oriented paradigm using APL, I'm getting a similar mind-bend when
        starting out on my FP journey.</p>
    <p><strong>You are presenting- <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Destructuring and Pattern Matching</a> / <a href="https://confengine.com/functional-conf-2018/proposal/7091/code-jugalbandi-exploring-concurrency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code Jugalbandi - Exploring Concurrency</a> -
        at the conference. What are some of the key takeaways from your sessions?</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>For the Destructuring and Pattern Matching demo - delegates can appreciate this tool that FP uses and how different languages like Erlang, Clojure, Haskell, Scala etc…have implemented it. Destructuring is about getting the innards of the data-structure while pattern matching is not
                only about matching relative positions and values of elements in the data-structure but also about dispatching to different functions based on the values inside data-structure. For those coming from OO background, we will see how we don't need the Visitor pattern when
                pattern-matching tool is available at our disposal.</p>

        <li>
            <p><a href="http://codejugalbandi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code Jugalbandi</a> - It was first debuted at <a href="https://confengine.com/functional-conf-2014" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Functional Conference 2014</strong></a> with <a

                Jaju</a>, <a href="https://confengine.com/user/morten-kromberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morten Kromberg</a> and myself are Exploring Concurrency. We plan to perform 2/3 melodies. We want to delineate Concurrency and Parallelism first as these two words have been used
                synonymously. We shall then see how FP helps us write concurrent code and rescues us from worrying about synchronization and race conditions. We will also see how etymologically the structure of sequential code and concurrent code was different, but with FP we are slowly getting to a
                point where they are looking similar.</p>

    <p><strong>What got you into Functional Programming (FP)?</strong><br>
        My first year programming lecturer at university was teaching us Java. One day he mentioned off-hand “I'd rather be teaching you my favourite language Haskell. It's very different; it doesn't even have loops!”. I thought to myself “What? No loops?! How could you do anything?” To<br>
        answer this question, I started learning Haskell a year later. I haven't looked back and haven't written a loop in years.</p>
    <p><strong>What has been your best moment or highlight working with FP?</strong><br>
        My highlight was Lambda Jam conference 2014 when I spent two days asking Edward Kmett questions. I learnt more in those two days than any other days I can think of. I have found the FP community in general to be full of smart people who are happy to help others learn.</p>
    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object orientated programmers?</strong><br>
        A lot of languages are adding functional tools and techniques as options. My advice is to spend some time learning Haskell, even if you will never use it in your job. Haskell is ruthless because it will only let you do functional programming. You're forced to learn! You can't accidentally
        fall into old habits and you have no choice but to use functional programming. Because of this, Haskell is the best vehicle I know of for teaching and learning functional programming.<br>
        You will come away with skills that will help you think about and solve problems in other languages, especially as more and more functional features are added to conventional languages. Haskell is definitely worth your time even if you will never use it in your job.</p>
    <p><strong>You are presenting - <a href="https://confengine.com/functional-conf-2018/proposal/7105/laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laws!</a> - at the conference. What are some of the key takeaways from your session?</strong><br>
        Functional programmers get several huge benefits by using abstractions which feature laws - invariants that must be satisfied by any instance of the abstraction. My talk will go into why we have laws, and show examples of situations where laws help us understand a situation, save<br>
        us from peril, or even help us get better performance from our code.</p>

    KUMAR</strong> Engineer @ Composewell Technologies Private Limited </a></h4>
    <p><strong>What got you into Functional Programming (FP)?</strong><br>
        I have worked on hard core systems for more than a decade. Imagine a large and complex C/C++ codebase for system's software with millions of lines of code, a new engineer taking more than a year to get the head or tail of it, and a new release taking more than a year to deliver. I worked
        towards modularizing and simplifying the spaghetti code to solve some of these problems. I left my job and started looking for ways to program better. Later, I figured that I was trying to reinvent a crude functional programming paradigm. I found that there is a whole new world of functional
        programming out there, it is highly evolved, a huge amount of research and engineering effort has gone into it. However, almost no one I worked with would ever have heard of the Haskell programming language, if you say the name Haskell it is sure to be confused with Pascal. For me it was
        like a dream suddenly coming true. I found that Haskell is the epitome of pure functional programming, something that I could only imagine earlier.<br>
        Now I am working towards bringing the composability and maintainability of Haskell to high performance systems. The larger goal is, whether you are writing a “hello world” or a distributed supercomputing program, you program in exactly the same way, it should be a child's play. I believe it
        is achievable with Haskell with some effort. <a href="https://github.com/composewell/streamly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Streamly</a> is a Haskell library towards that goal, it makes non-concurrent and concurrent programming indistinguishable.</p>
    <p><strong>What has been your best moment or highlight working with FP?</strong><br>
        When starting with Haskell I wrote a small program with a few hundred lines of code. After I was finished compiling it, I ran it and it worked flawlessly, while iterating on this program I could not find a single bug after compilation. I do not claim that you can never have a bug, but it is
        highly robust against language induced bugs because of a strong static type system. The compiler often reveals bugs in your thinking when the types do not fit in. When you are writing a C program the worst moment is before you try to run your program and you cross your fingers before
        shipping, with Haskell you get the shivers before you compile but you are mostly in peace after that. You can refactor a large Haskell code base fearlessly without worrying about correctness after the refactor. Try refactoring a large C code base, and experience the hell, well, only the

        Object oriented model is the only way to get some sanity in the imperative programming model. However, the problems with imperative model are deeply rooted. Managing state in a large complex software becomes very challenging because it is hard to track how and where state gets modified. It
        is easy to pass references but harder to find all the places where you can modify the contents of some memory. Adele Goldberg said, “In Smalltalk, everything happens somewhere else.” That is exactly the problem with imperative and object oriented programming. Pure functional programming just
        inverts the model, no function can ever change any memory outside it, the only way to communicate is through explicit output of the function. State management is explicit and carefully designed and therefore much easier to track what is going on and harder to make a mess. The best thing it
        brings is composablity, you can fearlessly put blocks together, they have much fewer and disciplined interactions with the rest of the code.</p>
    <p><strong>You are presenting- <a href="https://confengine.com/functional-conf-2018/proposal/6774/high-performance-haskell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">High Performance Haskell</a> - at the conference. What are some of the key takeaways from your session?</strong><br>
        If Haskell is so good, what is the catch? The functional model is dual (complementary) to the imperative model. The problems are also of the dual nature. When you refactor a C code base, it is bound to break the correctness of the program but performance is more or less unaffected. In
        Haskell it is the reverse, correctness of the program is maintained after a refactor but getting to the same performance levels may need some work. I have had a first hand experience of it during the development of Streamly. The key takeaways from this session are, (1) Haskell can compete
        with C with some work, (2) common pitfalls impacting performance, (3) ways to improve performance with some examples from my experience, (4) tools that may help when working on performance optimization.</p>

    <p><strong>What got you into Functional Programming (FP)?</strong><br>
        With FP constructs we can build concurrent and distributed applications easily and FP makes our code more concise and beautiful.</p>
    <p><strong>What has been your best moment or highlight working with FP?</strong><br>
        Initially I was working on Java, and While Java 8 came to the market with some new and major changes, I started exploring them. At that time, I realized the Java 8 collection streams power and importance which makes our code more declarative. At that time, I realized the power of FP and took
        a decision to move for the other pure FP languages for learning.</p>
    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object oriented programmers?</strong><br>
        I have an OOPs background, but that doesn't mean OOPS is now going to be history. The combination of OOP and FP, I see in Scala, it feels like if both of the paradigms combine, we can build huge applications easily and efficiently like Kafka, Akka and Spart are the major achievements of
        Scala.</p>
    <p><strong>You are presenting - Running Pure Functional Microservices On JVM - at the conference. What are some of the key takeaways from your session?</strong><br>
        From my session, I am sure people will learn about Scala, which is a pure FP tech stack and learn about new pure FP libraries of Scala.</p>
    <p><strong>The conference has a total of 54 sessions. Which of these sessions are you excited to attend?</strong><br>
        Is it really difficult to select specific sessions from the huge set of choices, But for me, JVM and Haskell based sessions excite me the most. I will try to attend the sessions of Haskell or JVM positively.</p>

    <p><strong>What got you into Functional Programming (FP)?</strong><br>
        I am always interested in numbers. Be it anything like finance or data processing. So, When I was doing C# full time as Enterprise Developer in HP, I came across some blog saying that F# (FP) is better to do data processing. And thing just stuck with me. It feels so natural while coding in
        F#. You don't need to go and understand different concepts to get started. Just write plain English and in most cases it will work.</p>
    <p><strong>What has been your best moment or highlight working with FP?</strong><br>
        After learning F# as language, I never got chance to directly work in it immediately. As I was working with Big Fat Enterprise application. There is task to process tabular data coming in from Excel Sheet. There are many validation based on columns and also dependent condition like column A
        is x then B has to be x' . In C# code is written more object oriented way, it was around 2500+ lines. More of “if and else” every where, process and pass data to next condition. But at the time of refactoring, I implement F# learning into C# (specifically in using Lambda beyond default Linq
        ) and code shrink down to 750 lines; became way more readable.</p>
    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object orientated programmers?</strong><br>
        I started with putting FP concepts in OOP language. It is always a good start. Understand a concept first and put it in whatever you are using it. Be it C# or Java. I missed delegate some much while working with Android that I wrote a wrapper based on reflection to mimic delegate. But one
        thing is for sure, Functional First will always be better then OOP first language having FP features when it comes developing large or complicated applications. If you like to have simple example, flute library never give that much readability that DSL in functional programming can give. And
        I do love fluent libraries so much. Also, there always will historical baggage for OOP languages like DI and other stuff that normally don't required when you are using Functional Programming concepts.</p>

        session?</strong><br>
        I will be sharing my experience of writing large scale front end application in Fable Elmish. That is very much similar to writing large scale application in Elm. So, I will be talking about what is possible instead of what can be possible with Elm like framework / Langugae. Also, what one
        needs to take care when we go beyond hello world / todo list application.</p>

    <p><strong>What got you into Functional Programming (FP)?</strong><br>
        I think mostly it was my curiosity to see if we can do better and prevent more bugs up front.<br>
        As a Java Developer I was frustrated a lot, especially as I saw what other languages like Swift were doing.<br>
        Eventually I ended up learning Scala and then it only took another year before I was fully converted to a functional programmer,<br>
        mostly thanks to the excellent “Functional Programming In Scala” book.</p>
    <p><strong>What has been your best moment or highlight working with FP?</strong><br>
        This is a tricky question, there's been quite a few. I think my favourite moment might have been when we were able to replace an old part of our service with something that was less than a fifth the lines of code. It wasn't just shorter, but it was also a lot simpler and therefore easier to
        work with. I think it made our team happier all around and that's what FP should be about!</p>
    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object oriented programmers?</strong><br>
        I think my advice to OOP programmers is the same as to any other programmers. Keep learning and never stop trying to improve!<br>
        Also be honest about the drawbacks of what you're currently doing. There might be a better way and if you stay curious, you might find it!</p>

        session?</strong><br>
        I'm going to present a couple of tips that helped me personally to achieve more confidence in our code base.<br>
        Those include using Tagless Final and the State monad for mocking and leveraging strong static types and property based testing.<br>
        Testing side-effects is really difficult and I hope I can alleviate that just a bit.</p>

    <p><strong>What got you into Functional Programming (FP)?</strong><br>
        Throughout my career I have had to solve a lot of different problems,but the same patterns keep appearing. As things get harder, whether due to inherently challenging problem domains or external forces like high volume or performance demands, you look for any tool you can use<br>
        to help manage the complexity. For me, this started with looking for better ways to manage state and co-ordination in distributed systems, and then trying to reduce bugs in code for really complicated problems. As I started to apply FP principles to the things I did, the<br>
        more places I found it useful, and that continues today.</p>
    <p><strong>What has been your best moment or highlight working with FP?</strong><br>
        The positive feedback of being able to help people learn and better understand FP. I have been lucky enough to contribute to and run numerous introductory and advanced FP workshops. The moment where someone you have helped along the way to applying FP in practice gets<br>
        back to you with their success stories, it is very rewarding.</p>
    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object oriented programmers?</strong><br>
        Start small. When it comes down to it, functional programming is just passing arguments to functions and eschewing complicated state and language features. This is something you can do in any language with - or without - FP specific language features. Build a feature with no<br>
        mutable variables, write a function that only works with its arguments and doesn't rely on shared state. As you do this more, you will both get better at it and start to pick up on the patterns that provide you the most value.</p>

        The goal of the property based testing workshop is to give people the tools that they need to have confidence applying property testing in practice. Property testing has the potential to make one of the most significant contributions to reducing bugs and increasing understanding of your code
        out of any of the easily adoptable FP techniques, however, to those without experience and property testing can be rather challenging to get started with. The workshop aims to<br>
        break down that barrier by teaching the mindset required to identify and implement useful properties, as well as showing some repeatable patterns that can be followed in almost every situation.</p>
    <p>Hanging on in Quiet Desperation: Time &amp; Programming is a retrospective look at FP as a tool for working with time as a first class entity in our systems. It looks at a how controlling time gives us the ability to build programs that are more powerful, easier to understand and work better
        than when we ignore time.</p>

    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object orientated programmers?</strong><br>
        Learning Haskell has made me a better OO programmer and a better programmer overall. I used to be an object oriented Java-only programmer myself. My advice to all my OO friends out there is to get yourself a copy of <em><strong>"Haskell Programming From First Principles"</strong></em> and
        learn Haskell. I know FP seems scary and that Haskell is harder and more foreign to you than something like Scala or Clojure, but you have to just go for it! Starting with Haskell forces you to truly embrace FP with no OO cheats/backdoors. Start an FP study group with your colleagues and see
        if you can get your employer on board to support your efforts!</p>

    <p><strong>What got you into Functional Programming (FP)?</strong><br>
        I work in APL, which uses an Array Oriented Paradigm which has many parallels to FP. I am arguably still still lurking on the periphery of FP. My involvement with the FP community started with the first FunctionalConf, where I was apparently recommended to the program committee as someone
        who might present something different and thought-provoking. I have been to every FunctionConf since then and have enjoyed every one tremendously!</p>
    <p><strong>What has been your best moment or highlight working with FP?</strong><br>
        I've been working in APL for 40 years now, it is really hard to pick a highlight. Working with Dhaval Dalal to put together last years Code Jugalbandi has been one of the best learning experiences. I find that giving presentations is very often the best way to learn something, it forces you
        to take a closer look than usual!</p>
    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object oriented programmers?</strong><br>
        The different paradigms all act as tools of thought for different parts of an application. If you are lucky enough to have a multi-paradigm language, my suggesting is that you use FP for the computational parts where clarity and succinctness, and the ability to run things in parallel, are
        important. In my opinion, OO remains a useful tool for describing interfaces and encapsulating data at a high level – but in APL we certainly try to avoid fine-grained objects because of the inefficiency of the resulting data structures. For large volumes of data, Arrays are the most
        efficient form of storage, and allow modern processors to reach maximum speed by reducing branching.</p>
    <p><strong>You are presenting - <a href="https://confengine.com/functional-conf-2018/proposal/7713/array-oriented-functional-programming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Array-oriented Functional Programming</a> / <a

        The array oriented paradigm that APL is built upon drives the user towards parallel, branchless algorithms that are simpler both for the human reader/writer – and for modern hardware to process. A day of immersion in APL is almost guaranteed to give you new ways to think about the way you
        process data, that you should be able to make use of no matter which programming language you use in your daily work.</p>
    <p><strong>The conference has a total of 54 sessions. Which of these sessions are you excited to attend?</strong><br>
        I'm still an FP newbie, so I'm hoping to advance my knowledge of Haskell – and get a better grip on pattern matching.</p>

    <p><strong>What got you into Functional Programming (FP)?</strong><br>
        It wasn't a single event, but strange as it may sound, moving to some serious Ruby from the usual C++ and Java world gave me an indication of how diverse the programming world is. The fact that I was using JRuby challenged all my assumptions about what I knew of the JVM too - a platform I
        was already much in love with. Armed with the knowledge that I did not know much, I started seeking out more. But the two big languages I came across happened to be Scala and Clojure. In that order.</p>
    <p>It's impossible to go away from FP now.</p>
    <p><strong>What has been your best moment or highlight working with FP?</strong><br>
        Again, it's been a journey. But one of my most exciting experiences involved replacing a troublesome, large-scale data fetching system with a ground-up rewrite in Clojure. The new code managed to replace the system in a very short time, fetching a billion+ data points every single day, and
        in literally 1/20th the LOCs. From about 105K lines of code, to just about 5K, and with the reliability and features required that caused the rewrite to happen in the first place.</p>
    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object orientated programmers?</strong><br>
        That's true - and programmers should find their sweet spots. Being effective is, in no small part, related to what you have in your toolbox and your investment in your programming language is a big part of it.<br>
        Having said that, and assuming other things being almost equal, the most important advice I'd have for anyone is to be sure how immutable datastructures are treated and supported in your language of choice. If they are not the default, your FP efforts are likely to simply fail.</p>

        If you are already sold to Clojure and are looking to take it to production from just being a hobby or your side-project, the workshop should give you enough material by way of examples and hands-on practice, on how you can take the next steps.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Developing ground-up? Everything it takes to start a new project, package and deploy. (Yes, as simple as this sounds!)</li>
        <li>Introducing Clojure to existing applications? How the JVM interop works, and how all it starts with is a JAR dependency that you can leverage from #1 above.</li>
        <li>Looking to convince your organization and showing them how it can be done? Anecdotes, examples, and the theory behind how it can be done. It's easier than introducing XML support in your application!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We'll look at hands-on experience with some basic libraries and applications (web, DB, concurrent processing with core.async, specs, and of course the most exciting part - the simplicity and uniformity in dealing with data from all kinds of sources)</p>

    <p><strong>What got you into Functional Programming (FP)?</strong><br>
        One Diwali vacation, I came across a blog mentioning Elixir language. It was posted in some Rails users group. Out of curiosity I googled to learn more. Then I learnt about pipe operator and the most exciting thing is we need less variables names. Because time taken to think variable name is
        more than time taken for writing code. Elixir is functional language. Honestly, this is how I got introduced to functional programming.</p>
    <p><strong>What has been your best moment or highlight working with FP?</strong><br>
        Apart from easy code navigation and refactoring, we also have an active community that helps! Does this answer count?</p>
    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object orientated programmers?</strong><br>
        I would say one should start adding FP principles in their code. Exercises on <a href="http://exercise.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exercise.io</a> and adventOfCode should help kickstart and then adopt in your code!<br>
        Like pair programming improves our skill.</p>

What are some of the key takeaways
        from your session?</strong><br>
        Generally the examples we see with ELM talk are a TODO list app or a calculator app; but its just one page app. A Real world app can be a social networking site or a SaaS app, etc consist of multiple pages, navigation between pages, Browser local storage, making API calls, etc. My talk
        should help to give a better idea on how to start with for a real world app.</p>

    <p><strong>What got you into Functional Programming (FP)?</strong><br>
        LISP, and Clojure got me into FP. I was a gnome, gtk fan back in college, contributing to GIMP, etc, and ESR's essays influenced me heavily. Working through SICP, and talking to the IRC community around gtk, and reading Paul Graham's essays got me real curious about this ancient, yet
        undying, enlightening experience of LISP. Oh, also JPL.<br>
        I started off my career as a ruby programmer though, and did some deep OO before I fell victim to the kingdom of nouns. At the same time, Steve introduced the folks at nilenso to Clojure, and I was sold hard. I lapped up all of Rich Hickeys's talks, and had my aha! moments with Clojure, and
        LISP. The paradigm got out of the way, and let me morph my thoughts into software.<br>
        I haven't looked back since.</p>
    <p><strong>What has been your best moment or highlight working with FP?</strong><br>
        FP aligned with my thought process, and made me a more effective programmer. Some of my best moments with FP were realising that functions are great abstractions, close feedback cycles with the REPL are warranted, and that it was a fine career choice to dive into FP.</p>
    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object orientated programmers?</strong><br>
        I've been through that trajectory myself. I've also seen others here at nilenso go through it. My advice would be to try it out. There's also some good books that can help you along.</p>

        Manual tests –automate→ Automated tests –automate→ Generative tests –automate→ ?<br>

    <p><strong>What got you into Functional Programming (FP)?</strong><br>
        Innocence (read: no experience) together with fun teachers and challenging problems! I was lucky enough to have a few university lecturers (Kostis Sagonas among them) that seemed to be having so much fun with SMLNJ, Haskell and Erlang; these teachers very vividly contrasted with those that
        taught C++, PHP or Java. After I was lured by Kostis and got my hands into Erlang's dialyzer tool, for my master thesis project, I never looked back. I am looking forward to transmitting the same passion to anyone attending my “Welcome to Erlang” workshop!</p>
    <p><strong>What has been your best moment or highlight working with FP?</strong><br>
        There have been several moments! The most professionally rewarding moment was presenting a paper at POPL'14, a top-tier conference, describing improvements for a testing technique for concurrent programs that were experimentally evaluated in an Erlang implementation. In later years, this
        improved technique and tool continued to evolve, leading to my PhD dissertation. From a completely different point of view, the achievement I am most proud of is qualifying for Round 2 of Google's Code Jam (among 3000 developers) using Erlang!</p>
    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object oriented programmers?</strong><br>
        A good software engineer can achieve good results regardless of the features of their languages and tools. However, it pays off to stay up-to-date with new developments in one's frameworks. The goal is to have clean, well organised and therefore maintainable code. Code in functional
        languages simply tends to be more succinct, making it a bit easier to achieve that goal.</p>

        In “Welcome to the Erlang Ecosystem” my goal is to convince you that Erlang is practical, fun and useful. I also want to answer all your questions about “why Erlang is like so and so” and perhaps the more smug “why Erlang solved all the problems 20 or more years ago”…! In “Conquerring race
        conditions in Erlang programs with Concuerror” I want to show you Concuerror, a very slick tool for testing concurrent programs. Concuerror can be used to teach people the intricacies of concurrency and can also be used to find errors or verify their absence in complex programs.</p>

    <p><strong>What got you into Functional Programming?</strong><br>
        I started my career as a C# developer. In in the initial years of my career, I was completely sold out to object-oriented programming and horning my OO skills by studying some of the best literature on this subject and applying them in my day-to-day work. In the last quarter of 2011, the
        team that I was working had decided to upgrade the .NET version from 2.0 to 4.0. During this transition, I came across the term “Functional Programming” for the first time in my life, and it was a “Love at first sight”.</p>
    <p>The methods that were 10-15 lines long have become 5-8 lines because of following FP, and I was super excited.</p>
    <p><strong>What has been your best moment or highlight working with FP?</strong><br>
        I was once asked to add some new features to a year old F# project, and those features require touching almost the entire codebase, and I was a little bit hesitant in the beginning because of it. But to my surprise, the whole implementation was very smooth. The compiler helped me a lot, and
        I made the changes freely. I delivered the project well ahead of the time, and I am still waiting for the first bug to come in.</p>
    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object oriented programmers?</strong><br>
        The focus should be on becoming better at what we do. Functional programming will help to look at the problem from a different point of view and gives you a new set of tools to solve the problem. So, keep an open mind and prepare yourself to unlearn certain things on the way. Trust me; once
        you overcome the initial challenges, you will experience a better programmer in you!</p>
    <p><strong>You are presenting - <a href="https://confengine.com/functional-conf-2018/proposal/6831/demystifying-functional-programming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demystifying Functional Programming</a> - at the conference. What are some of the key takeaways from your session?</strong><br>
        Functional Programming is not difficult; it is just different. If you are someone who is struggling to get your head around functional programming, you will be leaving my session by saying, Now I got it!</p>
    <p><strong>The conference has a total of 54 sessions. Which of these sessions are you excited to attend?</strong><br>
        I am looking forward to the <a href="https://confengine.com/functional-conf-2018/proposal/7288/using-haskell-to-build-a-performant-graphql-to-sql-compiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Using Haskell to build a performant GraphQL to SQL compiler</a> by <a

    <p><strong>What got you into Functional Programming (FP)?</strong><br>
        The rigorous mathematical foundations behind functional programming, and being bitten by one too many runtime errors in Python.</p>
    <p><strong>What has been your best moment or highlight working with FP?</strong><br>
        Working on some code for weeks, not running it but just checking that it compiles, and finding out that it worked perfectly the first time I tested it.</p>
    <p><strong>All the mainstream programming languages are adding functional programming features. Most new languages and frameworks are strongly influenced by FP. What is your advice to object oriented programmers?</strong><br>
        Don't try to turn all your verbs into nouns. Classes don't compose, functions do.</p>
